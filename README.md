# Motion Planning Experiments with Franka Robot
This repository is designed for conducting motion planning experiments using the Franka Emika robot. It provides tools for both simulation in Gazebo and real-world execution on the physical Franka robot. Built upon the official Franka ROS repository, this project extends its functionality to streamline motion planning workflows and experiments. Whether you're developing algorithms or testing robotic behaviors, this repository serves as a robust starting point for working with the Franka robot system.
